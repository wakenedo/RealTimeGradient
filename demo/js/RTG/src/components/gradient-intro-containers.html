          Gradient Containers let you bring
          <strong>interactive color flows</strong> to any part of your website.
          Think of them as <em>living design elements</em> — headers, cards,
          hero banners, or call-to-action blocks can now pulse with
          <strong>linear, radial, or text gradients</strong> that adapt in real
          time. <br /><br />
          With just a few lines of setup, you can schedule gradients to shift
          with the time of day, trigger <em>campaign-specific effects</em>, or
          update designs at runtime. This makes them perfect for
          <strong
            >landing pages, product highlights, and marketing campaigns</strong
          >
          where visual impact drives customer conversion. <br /><br />
          These are live examples of how containers can be styled — from smooth
          <strong>linear blends</strong> to dynamic
          <strong>radial bursts</strong> and even
          <strong>text-clipped gradients</strong>
          for typography that stands out.
